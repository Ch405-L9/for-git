PART 4: ITERATIVE WORKFLOW
Development Cycle
STEP 1: Generate Component
bash# Setup context
python files_to_prompt.py ~/bakery-mockup/data -o context.txt

# Upload to Claude with BUILD command
# "BUILD: [Component specification]"

# Save output to file
# Copy code to appropriate file in project
STEP 2: Test Component
bash# Run dev server
npm run dev

# View at http://localhost:3000
# Test functionality, responsive design
STEP 3: Iterate If Needed
bash# Load component for editing
python files_to_prompt.py ~/bakery-mockup/components/ComponentName.tsx -t -i -o comp.txt

# Upload with EDIT command
# "EDIT: [Specific changes needed]"

# Apply changes, retest
STEP 4: Move to Next Component
bash# Repeat cycle for next component/page
Batch Processing Multiple Components
bash# Generate all data files first
python files_to_prompt.py ~/bakery-mockup/data -o all-data.txt

# Upload to Claude with:
# "BUILD: Generate all 8 components listed in architecture. Provide complete code for each."

# Save each component to its file
# Test all at once
